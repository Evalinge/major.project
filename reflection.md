# Reflection 

### What advice would I give to myself if I were to start a project like this again?
- It is not a bad thing to revert to a previous version if debugging is not working. 
- Using a graph to visualize the mathematics behind your code is incredibly useful.
- Do not try to implement too manyn things at once, you will overwhelm yourself and it makes it much harder to locate errors.
- Do not consider it boring just because it may not appeal to others, this is a project for yourself and not them. 

### Did I complete everything in my 'needs to have' list?
- Sort of, I did manage at least a base level of each section. However I did not implement gravity physics, and only used math to determine objects' locations. 
- I have most celestial bodies, such as the sun, planets, and dwarf planets but I was not able to add moons or rings (The rings continously threw errors within a p5js built in function and the moons would not display properly). 
- I do have accurate data, meaning that it is to scale with the earth but using pixels and frame count does make complete accuracy a bit harder. 
- I would like to think that my project ended up rather visually appealing, I would have added more to the html, but it decided to fight me. I was able to include a header on the page, I customized the tab (title, favicon), and Luc Coutu found a way of implementing a 3D background that was not just a solid colour. 

### What was the hardest part of the project?
- The use of the eval function made debugging very difficult, as it would always throw the error within the eval even if the issue was something completely different. I found this stemmed from the inability to switch from strings to variable names in javascript. 

### Were there any problems I could not solve?
- I attempted to add a toggle for orbit display, this was built into the html and toggled a boolean controlling the orbit lines. For some reason, this broke everything and I spent too long trying to fix it before I decided to omit the toggle.
